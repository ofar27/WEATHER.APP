# Weather App

## Description
This is a simple Weather App that allows users to search for the current weather conditions of a city by entering its name. The app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays details such as:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Weather conditions with an appropriate icon

The app includes a user-friendly interface and supports dynamic error handling if an invalid city name is entered.
